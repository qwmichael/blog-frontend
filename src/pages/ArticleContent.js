            `Welcome! Today we're going to be talking about Anki. If you have never heard of Anki and 
            you are struggling on memorizing stuff, then this is a perfect opportunity for you to try 
            it out now. The link is <a href="//apps.ankiweb.net/">here</a>. If you are using a mobile device, you can search
            Anki up in the play store or app store. The installation should be very simple so I'm not going to go through it here.`,
            `<b> Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy. Because it's a lot 
            more efficient than traditional study methods, you can either greatly decrease your time 
            spent studying, or greatly increase the amount you learn. </b> This is the official description of what Anki is. You 
            might be wondering how this is going to help you improve your memorizing skill. You can think of it as pump card if 
            u have never used it before. What it does is to allow the user to create their pump card and also customize their 
            deck. If you are coming from a programming background like me, this gave us a very flexible way to manage our study. 
            You can choose to focus on the difficult concept more frequently. For example, you can choose to study a card daily 
            if you can't remember the meaning of the letter in that language. This will require a lot more time to accomplish 
            in the traditional method and Anki manage this hassle for us.  `,
            `
            Wait for a second, you might want to ask a question now, How can I study if I am too lazy to make my own deck?  
            The answer is very simple. YOU DON'T. The best feature that Anki developed is to share decks with other 
            learners. The link is right <a href="//ankiweb.net/shared/decks/">here</a>. This should be enough for you to get started. 
            Go get a new deck and start learning!! `,
