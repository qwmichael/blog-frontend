    <br/>
    <p>Hi all, Thanks for visiting my blog and my name is Michael, currently studying Software Engineering at UNSW Sydney. 
        The reason why I created this blog is to share some of my thought and the difficulty that I encounter in the learning process. I hope my articles can help anyone of you guys to understand new things or reinforce your existed knowledge. I have a lot of interest including Japanese, programming, reading and listening to music. Those will be mainly the content that I'm going to share.</p>

    <p>I'm currently looking for any oppotunity. Feel free to email me  <a href="mailto:michaelng9413@gmail.com">michaelng9413@gmail.com</a>.</p>
